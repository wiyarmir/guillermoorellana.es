# Who are you anyway?

I am a Telecommunications Technical Engineer (having received honours in [my thesis](#)).
I currently live in London, United Kingdom. At the moment I work as an Android Developer in [Badoo](https://corp.badoo.com).
They are cool guys, check them out!

# What are you focused in?

I push for excellence in every single thing I do. I am constantly looking for better ways to develop myself and thus, my code.
Continuous learning is a must.

My main focus is mobile technology, since I believe it is not the future but the present already.
I enjoy experimenting different approaches for it, including multitarget compilation with [Haxe](http://haxe.org/),
or hybrid approaches with custom frameworks.

As a secondary consequence, or perhaps part of the main focus, I do play around concepts like wereables or internet of things (IoT).

I do also enjoy creating some small games, mostly for mobile platforms, mostly all of them unfinished due to lack of time (whoops).

# Do you even have free time?

While I do invest quite some amount of my theoretically free time into investigating new technologies or improving my
skills in those I already know, that does not count as free time, does it?

I enjoy cooking (not so) complicated recipes (I bet this is the part of me who wanted to become a chemist), which I
proudly share in my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/wiyarmir). I also do like a lot traveling to new and old places,
and wearing off the sole of my shoes getting lost.

Back in Spain I used to play waterpolo for [Club Nataci√≥n Marbella](http://www.cnmarbella.es/), but unfortunately in
Wroc≈Çaw all I could do is just swim. I will try to fix that now that I am in London üòÅ
