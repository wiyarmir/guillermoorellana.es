I am Guillermo, and I was born in Spain. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Telecommunications (having received honours in [my thesis](https://github.com/wiyarmir/GeoNoise)). I currently live in London, United Kingdom. At the moment I work for [Monzo](https://monzo.com), where we are building the best bank ever.. I have previously worked at [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/media/about-skyscanner), [Badoo](https://corp.badoo.com) and [Coniq](http://coniq.com/) in London, and at [Credit Suisse](https://www.credit-suisse.com/microsites/careers-wroclaw/en.html) in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.

# What are you focused in?

My main focus is mobile technology, and making an effort to push its ubiquity forward, responsibly. I enjoy experimenting different approaches for it. Lately I have been very interested on [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html).

I push for excellence in every single thing I do. I am constantly looking for better ways to develop myself and thus, my code. Continuous learning is a must.

As a consequence, or perhaps part of the main focus, I do play around concepts like wereables or internet of things (IoT).

# Do you even have free time?

While I do invest quite some amount of my theoretically free time into investigating new technologies or improving my skills in those I already know, that does not count as free time, does it?

I enjoy cooking (not so) complicated recipes (I bet this is the part of me who wanted to become a chemist), which I proudly share in my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/wiyarmir). I also do like a lot traveling to new and old places, and wearing off the sole of my shoes getting lost.

Back in Spain I used to play waterpolo for [Club Nataci√≥n Marbella](http://www.cnmarbella.es/), but unfortunately in Wroc≈Çaw all I could do is just swim. I will try to fix that now that I am in London üòÅ
