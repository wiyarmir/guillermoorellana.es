**TL;DR:** It was my first time in Google I/O, my first time in the Bay Area, my first time in California, my first time in the US... And I came back with a very different opinion on all of them. 

#The long version
I am writing a very late recap. I could blame it to the fact that I am Spanish, but the ones who know me well would point out that's not usually an obstacle for my punctuality. It is a late one, because I have had experienced many things and have had a lot to assimilate. But let's do it one part at the time, shall we?

#Google I/O
Among all the first-time things on this trip, this was definitely the one I was the most excited about (it was the whole purpose of the trip, *duh*)

##The ~~conference~~ festival
Yes. The festival. If it looks like a festival, smells like a festival, tastes like a festival, you get sunburnt like in a festival... It is a festival, isn't it? *FestivalTypingâ„¢* at its finest!

It was hard to get into the sessions. Places were limited, so you had to queue. People queueing were kissed by a quite strong californian sun. So people got sunburnt. And angry, but mostly sunburnt.

Don't get me wrong, I **loved** the concept. I also do not think Google was unprepared or careless about it. They could have transmited the message a bit better, provided a bit more of shade... *But it was very clear it was going to be a festival.* And festivals are **hard** to manage. Not NP-hard, but sure it's right about there.

On the other hand, my opinion is that the last things that matter in a big event such as Google I/O are the actual sessions. It's 2016 people. Most of the sessions are livestreamed, and all of them are available on demand 24 hours after. So if you want to attend just to listen to it, well... It is not a concert, you will not find the difference between attending in person or through  YouTube in the comfort of your sofa - wait, maybe you *will* find it different.

The important bits are **the people** you meet there. I met fellow developers from all over the world (and a lot based in London I did not happen to have met yet!), writers from the tech media I consume daily. But the most unique oportunity perhaps, was to meet the googlers that make the tools I use on a daily basis as part of my job. I was able to express my frustrations, doubts and  problems. And some of them happened to be important enough!

Coming back to the unhappy people, my overall impression was that they were so used to in-building conferences and perhaps not too familiar with the place and the way the sessions were run, that they underestimated the sun of the Bay Area. Which brings me to...

#The Bay Area



#California

I did not have much time apart from the conference, so no fancy road trip to LA - this time at least.

#The United States

Some stereotypes were met. Some were not. 

In-n-out

#Final thoughts

Blah blah
